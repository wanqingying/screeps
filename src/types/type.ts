	Example types, expand on these or remove them and add your own.
	Note: Values, properties defined here do no fully *exist* by this type definiton alone.
		  You must also give them an implemention if you would like to use them. (ex. actually setting a `role` property in a Creeps memory)

	Types added in this `global` block are in an ambient, global context. This is needed because `main.ts` is a module file (uses import or export).
	Interfaces matching on name from @types/screeps will be merged. This is how you can extend the 'built-in' interfaces from @types/screeps.
